# Unity Car Game

## What you built? 

For this hack-a-thing, I followed [the first segment of a Unity Learn tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation?uv=2020.3&courseId=5cf96c41edbc2a2ca6e8810f) that taught the beginnings of scripting and the mechancis behind a player controller. The end goal is a game where you can drive a car along a road and avoid (or smash) crates.

## Who Did What?

I did this tutorial on my own!

## What you learned

I got to revisit the basics of Unity for development (rather than the design toolkit I'm more familiar with) and how to connect objects together, like the camera and the vehicle. I had some trouble connecting the inputs from the keyboard keys but generall didn't run into too many bumps.
